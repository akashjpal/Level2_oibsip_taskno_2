                Nobita is a young boy who suffers from poor grades and frequent
                bullying. In order to improve the life of his descendants, the
                robotic cat Doraemon is sent back in time by one of those
                descendants to protect and guide Nobita. Doraemon has a pocket
                from which he produces items known as "gadgets", which range
                from toys and medicines, to technology from the future. Some of
                these include the "bamboo-copter", a small head accessory that
                allows flight and the "Anywhere Door", a door that opens up to
                any place the user wishes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Nobita's closest friend is Shizuka Minamoto, who also serves as
                his romantic interest. Nobita is usually tormented by the
                bullying Takeshi Goda (nicknamed "Gian"), and the cunning and
                arrogant Suneo Honekawa. A typical story consists of Doraemon
                using one of his gadgets in order to assist Nobita in various
                ways, often causing more trouble than he was trying to solve.
